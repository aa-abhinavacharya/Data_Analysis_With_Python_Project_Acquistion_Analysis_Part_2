# Project :- Maven MegaMart Acquisition Analysis

### Note :- All the files used for data analysis are present in the repository. Project is prepared with the help of the course in Udemy [Python Data Analysis: NumPy & Pandas Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-pandas/) by Maven Analytics. Datasets are present in the link-[Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1LSaUhetg7Aq1411pQHI_w4qY7q_l-yzK) .

### Project Brief :- Maven MegaMart is currently exploring the acquisition of another retail company as part of a strategic initiative to expand its market share. This potential acquisition has reached the due diligence phase, during which several datasets related to the target company's customer behavior and sales performance have been provided.

### Objective Brief :- You have been selected to lead the in-depth analysis, which will be presented to senior management.  Your role is critical in uncovering insights from the provided data that will support decision-making during the acquisition process.This is in continuation to the data analysis performed in the repository [repo](https://github.com/aa-abhinavacharya/Data_Analysis_With_Python_Project_Acquistion_Analysis_Part_1/tree/main).

### Objectives :- 

1.Load data efficiently from multiple CSV files.

2.Conduct exploratory analysis on large-scale datasets.

3.Combine multiple DataFrames to create a comprehensive view.

4.Generate new columns to support deeper analytical insights.

5.Filter, sort, and aggregate data to identify and summarize critical information.

6.Work with date and time fields to perform time series analysis.

7.Create visualizations to effectively communicate key findings.

8.Streamline and optimize the data import workflow.

9.Export summary tables tailored for stakeholder review.

## How the insights help us in decision making for acquistion

#### Time-Based Analysis

1. Monthly Sales Trends :- Identify if overall sales are growing, declining, or seasonal. A steady upward trend may indicate healthy business momentum. It is useful to evaluate year-over-year growth and detect peak sales periods.

2.Sales Focused on April 2016 and October 2017 :- Zooming into specific months helps detect spikes or drops in performance. 

3.Year-on-Year Comparison (2016 vs 2017) :- Determines whether the business is scaling over time. A positive change would support the acquisition case.

4.Sales by Day of the Week :- Understand consumer behavior patterns .

#### Demographic Analysis 

1.Sales by Age and Income Group :- Helps identify high-spending customer segments. Informs Cantargeted marketing or loyalty strategies post-acquisition.

2.Average Household Sales by Age & Household Composition (HH_COMP_DESC) :- Reveals which demographic combinations (e.g., “older adults with no kids”) have the highest average spend.  Used to tailor promotions or product offerings to specific groups.

3.Transaction Matching with Demographics :- Ensures insights are based only on households where demographic info is available — leading to more accurate and actionable conclusions.

#### Product Demographics Analysis 

1.Sales by Age Group and Product Department :- Helps in understanding which departments resonate with each age group. For example, younger customers spend more on snacks, while older ones on healthcare.

2.Focus on Youngest Demographic :- Helps to discover what youngest customers are buying most — valuable for long-term customer acquisition and retention strategies.

### Strategic Takeaways

1. Identify growth trends and assess seasonality or marketing impact through time-series analysis.

2. Discover high-value customer segments based on demographics for targeted engagement.

3. Uncover which product lines are popular with specific groups, helping inform merchandising and cross-sell opportunities.

4. All of the above helps evaluate the target company’s market fit, customer diversity, and growth potential, which are essential when deciding on acquisition.
